# Train Game

This is an implementation of the 'train game', which is a game for bored people on trains in Sydney, Australia.

The rules are simple. Take the 4 digit train number (normally visible near the stairs inside a carriage) and perform simple arithmatic operations on them such that the result is 10.

For example, take the train number '1234'. We can make 10 by the the following sequence:

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10

also, 1 * 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.

You can even group digits, like so:

44 - 34 = 10
